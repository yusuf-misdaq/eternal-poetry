My hero is the real hero.\n\nI had a dream you never really loved me\nYou just wanted a higher platform for your self to \nLove yourself.\n\nI had a dream I never really loved you I was just \nSharpening my sword upon you.\n\n*\n\nI had this dream and I woke up \nAnd I looked in the mirror\n\nAnd I saw myself\nStill alive.\n\nI saw that there was still something there \nA small, fading light \nThat the dream did not speak of\nOr permit.\n\nA small memory of \nPurity\nResiding in the wound of one of my eyes.\n\nIf it were made to bloom again\nI might see a butterfly and a garden again.\n\nAs it is, I have nothing but this faint \nDistant \nGlimmer. So small\nIt’s barely a feeling\nAlmost just a theory.\n\n\n\nIn the dreadful dawn of the world I will sleep in tonight\nI must make myself believe \nThat this small glimmer\nIs worth believing in \nSo strongly that I let my life\nLean toward it\n\nAs the sun goes down\nI must believe in \nWhat barely seems\nPossible.",

If I don't let the world have some of my insides then how boring would the world be? I must induce this happy vomit. So must you. must must. \n\nSet it on fire and reject it. \n\nIf we all danced like criminals and insane people then one day we might taste the salty air of the sea, we might be on one of earth's edges feeling free. If we all forgot who we were. \n\nAnd somewhere under the moonlight of the timeless night somebody played 'Stand by Me' by Ben. E. King on crackly speakers over an old wooden boardwalk by a warm beach. The romantic strings of innocence and experience. The religious words of love. And a child like me walked past with family and remembered the moment for the rest of his adult life; and a couple stood inside one another, leant on some gate and inhaled the same style of love, they felt the moments tide reach up to their necks and drown them; and a lonely young man nearby was all destroyed and burnt inside as he cursed the earth; and insects moved around them all, keeping everything constant and continuous and connected.",

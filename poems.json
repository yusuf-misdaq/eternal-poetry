My hero is the real hero.\n\nI had a dream you never really loved me\nYou just wanted a higher platform for your self to \nLove yourself.\n\nI had a dream I never really loved you I was just \nSharpening my sword upon you.\n\n*\n\nI had this dream and I woke up \nAnd I looked in the mirror\n\nAnd I saw myself\nStill alive.\n\nI saw that there was still something there \nA small, fading light \nThat the dream did not speak of\nOr permit.\n\nA small memory of \nPurity\nResiding in the wound of one of my eyes.\n\nIf it were made to bloom again\nI might see a butterfly and a garden again.\n\nAs it is, I have nothing but this faint \nDistant \nGlimmer. So small\nIt’s barely a feeling\nAlmost just a theory.\n\n\n\nIn the dreadful dawn of the world I will sleep in tonight\nI must make myself believe \nThat this small glimmer\nIs worth believing in \nSo strongly that I let my life\nLean toward it\n\nAs the sun goes down\nI must believe in \nWhat barely seems\nPossible.",

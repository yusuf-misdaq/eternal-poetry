My hero is the real hero.\n\nI had a dream you never really loved me\nYou just wanted a higher platform for your self to \nLove yourself.\n\nI had a dream I never really loved you I was just \nSharpening my sword upon you.\n\n*\n\nI had this dream and I woke up \nAnd I looked in the mirror\n\nAnd I saw myself\nStill alive.\n\nI saw that there was still something there \nA small, fading light \nThat the dream did not speak of\nOr permit.\n\nA small memory of \nPurity\nResiding in the wound of one of my eyes.\n\nIf it were made to bloom again\nI might see a butterfly and a garden again.\n\nAs it is, I have nothing but this faint \nDistant \nGlimmer. So small\nIt’s barely a feeling\nAlmost just a theory.\n\n\n\nIn the dreadful dawn of the world I will sleep in tonight\nI must make myself believe \nThat this small glimmer\nIs worth believing in \nSo strongly that I let my life\nLean toward it\n\nAs the sun goes down\nI must believe in \nWhat barely seems\nPossible.",

If I don't let the world have some of my insides then how boring would the world be? I must induce this happy vomit. So must you. must must. \n\nSet it on fire and reject it. \n\nIf we all danced like criminals and insane people then one day we might taste the salty air of the sea, we might be on one of earth's edges feeling free. If we all forgot who we were. \n\nAnd somewhere under the moonlight of the timeless night somebody played 'Stand by Me' by Ben. E. King on crackly speakers over an old wooden boardwalk by a warm beach. The romantic strings of innocence and experience. The religious words of love. And a child like me walked past with family and remembered the moment for the rest of his adult life; and a couple stood inside one another, leant on some gate and inhaled the same style of love, they felt the moments tide reach up to their necks and drown them; and a lonely young man nearby was all destroyed and burnt inside as he cursed the earth; and insects moved around them all, keeping everything constant and continuous and connected.",

What would you like us to do with him?\nSincerely,\nJudge.\n\nDear Judge,\nThank you but I am utterly confused at your ridiculous question, what does it mean, and how on earth are you able to speak directly into my mind?\n\nDearest Yusufius,\nAs to your first question, it is a long story and involves your psyche, which also coincidentally answers your second question.\nBegone,\nJudge.\n\nDear Judge,\nNot good enough. Explain more on both fronts.\n\nDear Yusuf\nWe caught a burglar attempting to break in to property that belongs to you, clear enough? Also, I am able to talk to you because I am a part of you.\nLove,\nJ.\n\nDear J,\nWhat was he trying to break into? As for the latter point, it feels true, I will sit with it longer before speaking on it.\nLove,\nYu.\n\nYou clearly are a simpleton of simple tones, I bet your bedroom is painted pastel grey and you while away your days in worship of ephemeral haze.\nJiggy\n\nHow dare you rock my world. I'll have you know I'm a respected artist. I went to my cousins wedding the other day and she told me that all her friends call me her artist cousin, so you see, you have no grounds to judge me.\nYossle\n\nI have every grounds to judge you, not only because i am a trump appointed judge from the biden era, but because i am one of the deeper parts of you, so for the last time, your protestations fall on deaf ears insomuch as they are falling on your own ears insomuch as you are arguing with yourself so you really are winning nothing except for the right to call yourself the most schizophrenic person writing on his laptop in this cafe.\nJudge Judy\n\nYou're right. I admit it. It's easy to admit that you've got the better point (and that you are subsequently smarter than me) when I realize I am you and you are me\nYusuf\n\nExactly, see, that makes it easier for your vain dripping mind, doesn't it? You're not admitting defeat, you are celebrating your own intelligence ! Hurray for you ! You bloody earth dweller.\nJowels.\n\nSo anyway, remind me again why we're speaking.\nYu\n\nThere was a case of breaking and entering\nJu.\n\nWho broke and entered?\nY.\n\nYou broke and entered yourself\nJ.\n\nA part of me got into another part of me?\nY.\n\nVery good.\nJ.\n\nWhat part of me was it, and what part of me did it break into?\nY.\n\nNow you're asking the right questions, eisenstein.\nJ.\n\nIt's Einsten, Einsten.\nYine\n\nI don't make mistakes, and I got shhtyyle, Eisencrantz.\nJup.\n\nAnyway let's stay on track, before my slow slash long covid-addled brain slips up again, as it is wont to do, remind me: what part of me broke in? And where did it enter?\nY.\n\nIt was the part of you that rouses you, the part of you that is a trainer, a coach, a motivator, a tough-love giver. That is one of the myriad beings that live within you. It is why you didn't find the old trainer in the original Rocky film to be particularly shocking as others did when they first saw the film, even when he was being extra tough on Rocky, you understood. Because a part of you understands that giving tough love and harshly delivered, blunt proclamations is at times the best way of showing or telling someone something that they might otherwise be blind to. In short, if it helps, think of that aspect of your psyche as an older Buster Meredith spewing difficult to swallow truths in a raspy voice that cuts through all niceties and gentle illusions.\nYours forever,\nJudgeline Albright.\n\nOkay so I understand now what person it was who did the breaking and entering. You didn't answer the second part of my question, which was, what part of me did they break and enter into?\nYu\n\nI wanted to break up the dialogue so that there was space for the reader to breath since they are necessarily a half step behind us.\nJacques\n\nAgreed. I am an artist and have noted all my life that the audience often lags behind, at least the first time they are interacting with an artwork.\nYasser\n\nYou are right brother\nJamil\n\nLet us pray together, and the answer to the rest of the equation will come as it may, and we will stay open to it all, whether we receive an answer, whether life answers it slower than my slow covid, whether life says no to my request for an answer, or whether life answers it with a better question, and by life of course I mean the almighty force that lies hidden and present in all things, our Creator, who made this psyche to interspeak and this world of interwebbing technology and hearts that none can explain, the complexity of which no mind, not even the finest artificial mind, could ever begin to comprehend in its totality, save for our Creator, praised be its unknown Name.\nYusuf.\n\nALL: Amen.",

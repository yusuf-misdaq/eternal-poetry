            Yusuf Misdaq comes and goes, exits, enters. He was born in water and grows as a bird. His poetry is an echo of the world around us, and is intended as a balm and benefit for that same world. It is also an evocation from the inner-world of meditation, and here again, the hope is that is helps. Yusuf’s poetry ultimately draws from his living relationship to the Creator, the Prophets and Messengers. He is a Muslim, and within this, a follower of the Sufi way (more specifically the Naqshbandiya, a spiritual path that is native to his homeland of Afghanistan). Yusuf was born and raised in England, and presently lives in America. He has travelled and lived widely. More about his other art works (music, installation, video etc.) can be found on his artist website: https://yusufmisdaq.com   
        </p>
            <p>
                Eternal Poetry serves both as an archive of Yusuf's poetic works, as well as an installation that meditates upon the concept of 'random' (a Divine force). It also offers readers an ever-changing window into Yusuf's dynamic worlds, as expressed in verse. Each visit presents a new poem, inviting inspiration, discovery and contemplation. Yusuf first conceived of the concept whilst walking home from work one day in Hawai'i. The website took many years to build, initially realized with the help of a developer called Shahab Safdar from Pakistan. This current version of Eternal Poetry was coded by Yusuf (with a little CSS help from Claude AI) and is now hosted on Yusuf's own server to minimize (corporate-driven) interruptions to service. What you are browsing today is much closer to the original concept. Please use the new 'Share this Poem' function to spread the word, please leave (anonymously, if you wish) your own 'Comments' on any poem, and please support this art and the energy it has taken to share it; it is given openly, with good intentions and with great hopes.

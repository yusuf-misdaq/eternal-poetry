                Yusuf Misdaq comes and goes, exits, enters. He was born in water and grows as a bird. His poetry draws from his living relationship both to God and the Prophets. He is a Muslim and follows the Sufi path, specifically the Naqshbandiya, native to his homeland of Afghanistan. He has spent most of his life in England and America, but travelled widely.  
            </p>

            <p>
                His work has appeared in various collections including Brighton Streets, The Butterfly Gate, Into Solidity, and other volumes. His poems are characterized by their intimate voice, careful attention to imagery, and exploration of transience and permanence.
            </p>

            <p>
                Poetry Eternal serves as an archive and experimentation with the Divine power of 'random,' while also offering readers an ever-changing window into his worlds. Each visit presents a new poem, inviting discovery and contemplation. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
Yusuf first conceived of the idea walking home from work one day while living in Hawai'i. The website took many years to build, and was initially undertaken with the help of a kind developer called Shahab Safdar from Pakistan. This current version was coded by Yusuf with a little help from Claude AI and hosted on Yusuf's own github to minimize potential technical interruptions.

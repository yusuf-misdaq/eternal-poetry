            Yusuf Misdaq comes and goes, exits, enters. He was born in water and grows as a bird. His poetry is one of his legacies. It draws from his living relationship both to God and the Prophets. He is a Muslim and follows the Sufi path, specifically the Naqshbandiya, native to his homeland of Afghanistan. He has spent most of his life in England and America, but travelled / lived widely.  
        </p>
            <p>
                Eternal Poetry serves both as an archive of Yusuf's poetic works, as well as an installation that meditates upon the concept of 'random' (a Divine force). The website also offers readers an ever-changing window into Yusuf's dynamic worlds as expressed in verse. Each visit presents a new poem, inviting inspiration, discovery and contemplation. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
Yusuf first conceived of the idea for Eternal Poetry whilst walking home from work one day in Hawai'i. The website took many years to build, initially realized with the help of a kind developer called Shahab Safdar from Pakistan. The current version of Eternal Poetry was coded by Yusuf (with a little CSS help from Claude AI) and is now hosted on Yusuf's own server to minimize corporate-driven interruptions to service. Please enjoy the new 'Share this Poem' function, please leave (anonymously, if you wish) your own Comment on any poem, and please support this art and work which is given openly with good intentions.</p>
